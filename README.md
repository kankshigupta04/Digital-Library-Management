DIGITAL LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
<br>
The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its
each and every functionality.
<br>
Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single
project. 
<br>
The project will be a web based project with a database server responsible for
maintaining every single detail of the Library. 
<br>
It has a very user friendly interface which can
easily be operated by any non-technical person.
